I was tasked with modernizing the website, organizing and distilling the content into more digestible chunks, and making the site more user friendly. I also added a booking system to the website. With all the changes made the company saw a 30% increase in bookings within 3 months.'

We wanted to help other dog owners avoid the same issues we had. We built the website to help educate dog owners on the benefits of raw feeding and to help them find the right food for their dog. The website allows users to log in, set up recurring orders, and collect and track their points.'
